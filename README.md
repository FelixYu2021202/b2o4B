# A "Bobified" b2o4B

Bob refers to my friend [happybob](https://www.luogu.com/user/332914).

Every number in this 2o4B is "Bobified":

- `8` to `B`
- `0` to `o`
- `6` to `b`

## How to use

If you are using Windows, you can simply run `dist/b2o4B.exe`.

If you want to compile by yourself, be sure to include the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library.
